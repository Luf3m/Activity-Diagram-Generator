**Activity Diagram Generator Documentation**

**Introduction:**
The Activity Diagram Generator is a command-line tool that allows users to generate activity diagrams using YUML syntax from textual descriptions of activities and transitions. This documentation provides instructions on installing, using, and understanding the Activity Diagram Generator.

**Installation:**
1. Clone or download the Activity Diagram Generator repository from GitHub: [Activity Diagram Generator Repository](https://github.com/your-repository-url)
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x).
3. Install any required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project directory.

**Usage:**
To use the Activity Diagram Generator, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Activity Diagram Generator files.
3. Run the following command to start the generator:
   ```
   python activity_diagram_cli.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to input textual descriptions of activities and transitions.
5. The generated activity diagram in YUML syntax will be displayed in the terminal.

**Supported Syntax:**
The Activity Diagram Generator supports the following syntax for describing activities and transitions:
- Each activity and transition should be specified on a separate line.
- Activities should be described using simple text labels.
- Transitions between activities should be indicated using '->' arrows.

**Example:**
Here's an example of supported syntax and the corresponding generated activity diagram:

**Input (Textual Descriptions):**
```
Start
User enters username
System validates username
If username is valid
    System prompts for password
Else
    System displays error message
End
```

**Output (Generated Activity Diagram in YUML Syntax):**
```
[Start]->[User enters username]
[User enters username]->[System validates username]
[System validates username]->[If username is valid]
[If username is valid]->[System prompts for password]
[If username is valid]->[System displays error message]
[System prompts for password]->[End]
[System displays error message]->[End]
```

**Sample Textual Descriptions and Generated Activity Diagrams:**

**Input 1:**
```
Start
User requests information
System processes request
System retrieves data
System presents information
End
```

**Output 1:**
```
[Start]->[User requests information]
[User requests information]->[System processes request]
[System processes request]->[System retrieves data]
[System retrieves data]->[System presents information]
[System presents information]->[End]
```

**Input 2:**
```
Start
User selects item
If item is available
    System adds item to cart
Else
    System displays out of stock message
End
```

**Output 2:**
```
[Start]->[User selects item]
[User selects item]->[If item is available]
[If item is available]->[System adds item to cart]
[If item is available]->[System displays out of stock message]
[System adds item to cart]->[End]
[System displays out of stock message]->[End]
```
